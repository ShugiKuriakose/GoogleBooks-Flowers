# IMPORTANT

- Deploy to github
- Document everything clearly
- Make sure you add tests

# Tips

- Make sure you plan first (break up the project into tiny tasks)
- Get help from a coach with planning if you need it! It's what we are here for
- Get your google books integration done as quickly as possible
- Keep your scope tight to the MVP before moving onto new features
- Make sure you plan additional features thoroughly
- Send it to
  @Calum Hill-Cawthorne
  as soon as the MVP is done for feedback

# Google Books Tech Test

- The candidates are required to develop a basic front-end application with the following features:
- Fetch and display a list of books related to flowers from the following REST API: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=flowers
- Present the fetched data in a table, including book title, authors, and published date.
- Enable users to view more details of a selected book, such as title, subtitle, authors, image, and description.
- Encourage the candidates to showcase their creativity and add a personal touch to the application.
- Include a README file explaining the app's features and the creative elements introduced. (use the template in the post course repo)

# Additional Features that you could add once the MVP is done (but not limited to)

- Sorting books by title, author, publish date
- Book search
- Add search history
- favouriting books (could be done with redux)
- books rating system (could be done with redux)
- adding personal reviews to your books (could be done with redux)
  using google books API collections features
- Getting good reads links and displaying them on the page
- Book form for submission for books you can't find in the API (react-hook-form)

# Technology Recommendations (to get the most out of this project)

- React
- React Testing Library (always always always test everything you possibly can)
- Typescript
- Redux
- React Query
- Don't use an out of the box table library, build one yourself (break it down, scope it, build it)
- Give tailwind a go, tip: have the docs open at all times

# Additional Tips for the Tech Test:

- Component tests are a must
- Use the documentation template from the post course repo
- Code styling and formatting needs to be immaculate (use prettier)
- Use React best practices
- I would recommend at least adding one other feature after the MVP

theres some really meaty features in the feature list that you wouldn't have touched too:
Sorting books by title, author, publish date
Book search
Add search history
favouriting books (could be done with redux)
books rating system (could be done with redux)
adding personal reviews to your books (could be done with redux)
using google books API collections features
Getting good reads links and displaying them on the page
Book form for submission for books you can't find in the API (react-hook-form)
